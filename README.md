# Brick_Breaker

A simple 2D Breakout clone made using my BINDU v1.0.0 Game Engine framework.
<br/> The game mechanics and features are almost complete except the assets and level design.
<br/> New levels can be added using the Tiled Map Editor.
<br/> Open the project using visual studio, compile and run it, or find the already compiled executables inside their respective build configuration folder in the x64 folder.
